# Centralized UPI Payment Gateway

A secure, blockchain-integrated UPI payment system implementing Lightweight Cryptography (LWC), Quantum Cryptography simulation, and SHA-256 hashing for enhanced transaction security.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

This project simulates a complete digital transaction ecosystem using three distinct entities:

- **UPI Machine**: Central processing unit mimicking merchant sound-box machines
- **User Platform**: Client interface for payment initiation via QR code scanning
- **Bank Terminal**: Banking server for transaction validation and processing

## üîê Security Features

### Lightweight Cryptography (LWC)
- **SPECK Algorithm**: High-speed encryption for resource-constrained environments
- **Virtual Merchant ID (VMID)** generation from Merchant ID and timestamp
- **QR Code Encryption** for secure merchant identification

### Blockchain Integration
- **Immutable Transaction Ledger** maintained by each bank
- **Transaction Block Structure**:
  - Transaction ID (Hash of UID, MID, Timestamp, Amount)
  - Previous Block Hash
  - Timestamp
- **Transparent and Verifiable** transaction history

### Quantum Cryptography Simulation
- **Shor's Algorithm Implementation** to demonstrate PIN vulnerabilities
- **Classical Cryptography Vulnerability Assessment**
- **Quantum-resistant Security Analysis**

## üè¶ Banking System

### Registration Process
- **Merchant Registration**: Name, IFSC Code, Password, Initial Balance
- **User Registration**: Similar to merchant + PIN setup for UPI transactions
- **Unique ID Generation**: 16-digit hexadecimal numbers using SHA-256 hashing

## üîÑ Transaction Flow

1. **Merchant Registration** ‚Üí Bank generates 16-digit Merchant ID (MID)
2. **QR Code Generation** ‚Üí UPI Machine encrypts MID using LWC
3. **User Scans QR Code** ‚Üí Provides MMID, amount, and PIN
4. **Transaction Processing** ‚Üí UPI Machine decrypts and forwards to bank
5. **Bank Validation** ‚Üí Verifies credentials and available balance
6. **Blockchain Recording** ‚Üí Valid transactions stored immutably
7. **Fund Transfer** ‚Üí Completion notification to all parties
